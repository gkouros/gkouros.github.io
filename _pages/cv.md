Work experience
======
* 2019-Now: Industry 4.0 Consultant
  * Organization: Kapernikov CVBA
  * Duties: Worked on computer vision based forklift localization, quality testing of industrial products, and industrial operation monitoring. Also, organized a company wide knowledge-sharing workshop on ROS, Visual Odometry and Visual SLAM.

* 2017-2018: Research Assistant
  * Organization: Information Technologies Institute - CERTH
  * Duties: Was responsible for the development of an autonomous robotic system for subsurface utility mapping as part of Project BADGER (EU Horizon 2020). Focused on the development of algorithms for autonomous navigation of a tractor-trailer UGV and autonomous subsurface mapping with a ground penetrating radar.
  * Supervisors: Dr. Dimitrios Giakoumis, Dr. Ioannis Kostavelis

* 2014-2016: Volunteer Robotics Engineer
  * Organization: Pandora Robotics Team
  * Duties: As a member of a university robotics team, I had the opportunity to work on all the stages of development of an advanced autonomous UGV for search-and-rescue operations (hardware, sensor/actuator drivers, testing, simulation, control, localization, mapping, and navigation).
  * Supervisors: Associate Professor Loukas Petrou
